APPLICATION DEVELOPMENT


Relational Database
    - Most of the startups are now dependent on the scattered data of the users. [where they are browsing? which types of 
      content they consumes? etc]. If we want to store these data in sql database. Then we have to define schema for such 
      data. If after a while we get some different type of scattered data then we have to declare another schema to store 
      the data and this will continue whenever we get new shaped data. This is a huge problem for the developer. To solve 
      this issue, nosql databases came into the market
    - in this nosql databases there is no need to maintain schema. Though data are from different collection, we can 
      store them in the same database. There is no shape [schema] for data. Schema er problem holo data ke shape dite gele
      kichu data either missing jabe or duplicate hobe
    - JOINT [to join different data table]. This is called Database Normalization
      Jei table e jototuku data thaka dorkar oi table e tototuku-i data thakbe. Then eder moddhe ekta pivot table banaye 
      ederke ektar sathe arekta ke joint kore dilei hobe. [ek table e sob info eksathe rakhle eta maintain kora onek tough]
      Tai main data koyekta segment vag kore alada alada table e rakhe joint kore deya hoy. User jokhon tar sob data chay
      tokhon multiple table theke tar data niye eksathe marge kore take deya hoy. RDBMS er ei ekta problem that data joint
      kora khub costly keta process.
    - We can solve this problem using a simple JSON object
