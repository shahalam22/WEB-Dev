MongoDB documentation highly recomended

First of all we have to connect mongodb database with local host. 
mongo - Command to do connect mongodb with localhost
help - to see the command list of mongodb
show dbs - to show all the databases in localhost
use db_name - to create[if doesn't exist] & switch to the database names db_name
db - to see current working database
db.createCollection(Collection_name) - to create collection
show collections - to see all the collections of the current database
db.dropDatabase() - to delete database. But to do this first we have to move the database we want to delete
db.collection_name.insertOne({}) - to insert one data
db.collection_name.insertMany([{}, {}, {}]) - to insert multiple data
db.collection_name.find() - to read documents from the database
db.collection_name.find().pretty() - to read formatted document from the database
db.collection_name.find(property) - to read documents that only contains that property
db.collection_name.find(property).limit(n) - here we will see maximum n numbers of documents in this property-wise search
db.collection_name.find(property).limit(n).pretty()
db.collection_name.update({where to update},{$set : {updated data}}) - this is being used to update data. There is also methods updateById, updateMany, etc.
db.collection_name.deleteOne({id}) - to delete one document
