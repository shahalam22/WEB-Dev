* CSS SYNTAX : selector {property:value; property:value;}

* The selector points to the HTML element you want to style

* We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:
    - Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
    - Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)

    - Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
        link : https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_pseudo_classes.asp     
    - Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)

    - Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)

* The id selector uses the id attribute of an HTML element to select a specific element. To select an element with a specific id, write a hash (#) character, followed by the id of the element.
* The class selector selects HTML elements with a specific class attribute. To select elements with a specific class, write a period (.) character, followed by the class name.
* A class name cannot start with a number!
* In this example the <p> element will be styled according to class="center" and to class="large": <p class="center large">This paragraph refers to two classes.</p>
* "*" is the CSS universal selector
* h1 {                  p {
        fkjlaksj;           jkhklanak;
        ashfkjald;          skjfsfskfn;
    }                      }

    here this css style will be applied in all the <h1> or <p> tags. So, this is called CSS group selector

*   h1 {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
    }

    h2 {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
    }

    p {
        text-align: center;
        color: red;
    }
     
    this can be written like : 

    h1, h2, p {
            text-align: center;
            color: red;
    }

* There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:
        External CSS - alada css file khule otate style kore html file e link kora. precedence-*
        Internal CSS - head er moddhe style tag diye style kora. precedence-**
        Inline CSS - tag er moddhe style attribute use kore style kora. precedence-***

* sometimes hexCode be 3 digit i.g. we can write #ffcc00 as #fc0
